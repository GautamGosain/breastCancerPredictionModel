# breastCancerPredictionModel

Machine Learning model using Python for classifying Breast Cancer in 2 different categories with fairly good accuracy

Implemented Logistic Regression using PyTorch, NumPy, Sklearn, Torchvision and Matplotlib libraries of Python

Calculated Binary Cross Entropy Loss (Log Loss) and minimized it by modifying the parameters in each iteration

Obtained accurate parameters using Stochastic Gradient Descent and determined the best learning rate for the model
